Amidst a flurry of phone calls and flight reservations Will and Alexx raced down to Los Gatos to load much of Will's apartment into a rental car. Within 48 hours the couple was back in Lake Oswego, accompanied by over 100 of Will's houseplants. Alexx's apartment had been transformed into a tropical frenzy of monsteras and alocasia, much to Loki's chagrin.

You complete me in ways I didn‚Äôt even know I needed, you are my blind spot. I know I have been feeling this for a long time even though I was running from it. I just wanted to be really sure because I have never experienced love like this, but I love you so much Will. I harbor so much fear in my life these days, and I‚Äôm not going to get let that encompass how I feel about you. I‚Äôm all in Will and I think I have know that since the night we met."

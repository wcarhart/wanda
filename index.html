									<hr>
									<p>On a random Friday night, a mutual friend of Alexx and Will, Cameryn, invited a group to go out to a bar called Kilowatt in Ocean Beach. Prior to the evening's festivities, Cameryn asked Alexx <i>I invited my friend Will, do you think he's cute?</i> to which Alexx replied, <i>eh, no</i>. <span class="alexx">Correction: Alexx shrugged, and no words were said.</span></p>
									<p>However, when Will showed up to meet Cameryn and company, Will noticed that Alexx couldn't take her eyes off him; she stared at him from across the room. <span class="alexx">Correction: our eyes immediately, mutually locked, until Alexx hastily turned away after realizing that too much time had passed.</span> They clicked instantly and spent the whole night chatting, realizing they had numerous mutual friends from USD. At the end of the evening, we walked out to our vehicles, and Will asked for her number.</p>

									<p>After a few long months of job searching, Will got an offer to join a revolutionary company up in the San Francisco Bay Area called <a href="https://wisk.aero" target="_blank">Wisk</a>. Wisk gave him a great offer, awarding him the title he wanted and offering to relocate him to the bay. He had been rigorously searching for a new job and was happy to see his hard work pay off, but also realized that he didn't want to move away from Alexx.

He didn't want to pressure Alexx into committing to a long-distance relationship, but he really enjoyed the time they had spend together up until this point and wanted to keep dating. Alexx reciprocated that she felt the same. The two defined their relationship and were each excited to see what the future held.</p>

If I'm ever having a stressful day, you calm me down and make me laugh, and I'm so lucky to call you mine this Christmas.</p>
									<p>I wanted to give you something that we could use together on one of our adventures. I hope you like it and smile every time we use it! üòä</p>

									<hr>
									<p>After a few long months of job searching, Will got an offer to join a revolutionary company up in the San Francisco Bay Area called <a href="https://wisk.aero" target="_blank">Wisk</a>. Wisk gave him a great offer, awarding him the title he wanted and offering to relocate him to the bay. He had been rigorously searching for a new job and was happy to see his hard work pay off, but also realized that he didn't want to move away from Alexx. Will knew he wanted to stay with Alexx regardless of where he worked.</p>

									<p>Shortly after celebrating the job offer, Will and Alexx talked about what was next in their relationship. Will shared that in the incoming uncertainty surrounding his new job, spending time with Alexx calmed him down and made him happier than anything else. He didn't want to pressure Alexx into committing to a long-distance relationship, but he really enjoyed the time they had spend together up until this point and wanted to keep dating. Alexx reciprocated that she felt the same. The two defined their relationship and were each excited to see what the future held.</p>

The two both love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudy_with_a_Chance_of_Meatballs_(film)" target="_blank"><i>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</i></a>, and so they decided to be Sam Sparks and Flint Lockwood from the movie.

									<p>One of the reasons Will thinks Alexx is so fantastic is because she loves spending time outside. He was so excited to learn that she loves camping as much as he does. They planned a few trips out to state parks near them in San Diego, exploring Laguna and Julian.</p>
									<p>In between hiking and cuddling in the tent, the two loved driving into downtown Julian to get a breakfast full of pie. Exploring the great outdoors is such a wonderful thing they can enjoy together.</p>

									<p>After moving back to the San Francisco Bay Area in November, Will was able to venture down to San Diego to visit Alexx in December. Amongst many other fun activities, Will and Alexx explored Balboa Park during December Nights. The park was beautifully lit for the event, with plenty of Christmas trees to enjoy and stalls tempting them with exotic food. A myriad of cute puppies wandered the park as Will and Alexx basked in the wonder of the giant Christmas tree in the middle of the festivities.</p>

									<p>Hey Alexx üòä</p>
									<p>I hope you're having a merry, merry Christmas!! This is a temporary message that I'll change later after we've actually had our first Christmas!</p>
									<p>I still can't believe how lucky I am. I wake up every day lucky to be dating such a caring, thoughtful, and driven person - a literal goddess on earth. You inspire me every day to be the best version of myself. I love camping with you, eating with you, dancing with you, and I just can't get enough of you. You make me <strong>so</strong> happy. If I'm ever having a stressful day, you calm me down and make me laugh, and I'm so lucky to call you mine this Christmas.</p>
									<p>I wanted to give you something that we could use together on one of our adventures. I hope you like it and smile every time we use it! üòä</p>
									<p>Love,<br>Will ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

									<hr>
									<p>On a random Friday night, a mutual friend of Alexx and Will, Cameryn, invited a group to go out to a bar called Kilowatt in Ocean Beach. Prior to the evening's festivities, Cameryn asked Alexx <i>I invited my friend Will, do you think he's cute?</i> to which Alexx replied, <i>eh, no</i>. <span class="alexx">Correction: Alexx shrugged, and no words were said.</span></p>
									<p>However, when Will showed up to meet Cameryn and company, Will noticed that Alexx couldn't take her eyes off him; she stared at him from across the room. <span class="alexx">Correction: our eyes immediately, mutually locked, until Alexx hastily turned away after realizing that too much time had passed.</span> They clicked instantly and spent the whole night chatting, realizing they had numerous mutual friends from USD. At the end of the evening, we walked out to our vehicles, and Will asked for her number.</p>

									<p>After a few long months of job searching, Will got an offer to join a revolutionary company up in the San Francisco Bay Area called <a href="https://wisk.aero" target="_blank">Wisk</a>. Wisk gave him a great offer, awarding him the title he wanted and offering to relocate him to the bay. He had been rigorously searching for a new job and was happy to see his hard work pay off, but also realized that he didn't want to move away from Alexx.

He didn't want to pressure Alexx into committing to a long-distance relationship, but he really enjoyed the time they had spend together up until this point and wanted to keep dating. Alexx reciprocated that she felt the same. The two defined their relationship and were each excited to see what the future held.</p>

If I'm ever having a stressful day, you calm me down and make me laugh, and I'm so lucky to call you mine this Christmas.</p>

									<hr>
									<p>After a few long months of job searching, Will got an offer to join a revolutionary company up in the San Francisco Bay Area called <a href="https://wisk.aero" target="_blank">Wisk</a>. Wisk gave him a great offer, awarding him the title he wanted and offering to relocate him to the bay. He had been rigorously searching for a new job and was happy to see his hard work pay off, but also realized that he didn't want to move away from Alexx. Will knew he wanted to stay with Alexx regardless of where he worked.</p>

Will shared that in the incoming uncertainty surrounding his new job, spending time with Alexx calmed him down and made him happier than anything else. He didn't want to pressure Alexx into committing to a long-distance relationship, but he really enjoyed the time they had spend together up until this point and wanted to keep dating. Alexx reciprocated that she felt the same. The two defined their relationship and were each excited to see what the future held.</p>

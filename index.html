				<h1>Hi there!</h1>
				<p class="lead">Welcome to <code>wanda</code>!</p>
				<p class="lead">In December 2019, I wanted to give my girlfriend more than just a standard Christmas card. Being the strapping young software engineer I was, I decided to make her a virtual Christmas card that would capture the memories from our relationship so far. The result was alexxandwill.us, dubbed the codename <code>wanda</code>, short for <i>Will and Alexx</i>, to keep the project under wraps until it was ready.</p>
				<p class="lead">What started as a Christmas card with a few dates has blossomed into a fun, interactive way for me and Alexx to look document our adventures. I can't wait to keep adding to the memories.</p>
				<p class="lead">Love you, Alexx.</p>

									<h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted">September 6th, 2019</h6>
									<hr>
									<p>On a random Friday night, a mutual friend of Alexx and Will, Cameryn, invited a group to go out to a bar called Kilowatt in Ocean Beach. Prior to the evening's festivities, Cameryn asked Alexx <i>I invited my friend Will, do you think he's cute?</i> to which Alexx replied, <i>eh, no</i>. <span class="alexx">Correction: Alexx shrugged, and no words were said.</span></p>
									<p>However, when Will showed up to meet Cameryn and company, Will noticed that Alexx couldn't take her eyes off him; she stared at him from across the room. <span class="alexx">Correction: our eyes immediately, mutually locked, until Alexx hastily turned away after realizing that too much time had passed.</span> They clicked instantly and spent the whole night chatting, realizing they had numerous mutual friends from USD. At the end of the evening, we walked out to our vehicles, and Will asked for her number.</p>

									<p>It wasn't long after the two had met that they had their first date. Having gone out two days prior to Ocean Beach, Alexx suggested that they go to taco place that Will mentioned in OB - South Beach Bar and Grill. The two had a wonderful time talking about a plethora of topics from their majors to their siblings and families.</p>
									<p>Will left their first date starstruck. He couldn't believe he hadn't met Alexx sooner - he thought she was caring, hardworking, and drop-dead gorgeous. As soon as he got home, he started planning their next date. <span class="alexx">After Alexx was dropped off, she instantly called her best friend and texted her family about an amazing and handsome guy she just met.</span></p>

									<p>It only took a few dates for Will to realize he really liked Alexx. One day, Alexx asked Will if he would be her date to a military event recognizing a family member's commitment to a branch of the US Air Force: <i>the Flying Tigers</i>. Will excitedly accepted.</p>
									<p>At the event, Will met some of Alexx's extended family, including her grandparents. He was wowed, but not surprised, by how fun and kind Alexx's family was. The two had a lovely evening, learning about the Flying Tigers and dancing together.</p>

									<p>After a few long months of job searching, Will got an offer to join a revolutionary company up in the San Francisco Bay Area called <a href="https://wisk.aero" target="_blank">Wisk</a>. Wisk gave him a great offer, awarding him the title he wanted and offering to relocate him to the bay. He had been rigorously searching for a new job and was happy to see his hard work pay off, but also realized that he didn't want to move away from Alexx. Will knew he wanted to stay with Alexx regardless of where he worked.</p>

Will shared that in the incoming uncertainty surrounding his new job, spending time with Alexx calmed him down and made him happier than anything else. He didn't want to pressure Alexx into committing to a long-distance relationship, but he really enjoyed the time they had spend together up until this point and wanted to keep dating. Alexx reciprocated that she felt the same. The two defined their relationship and were each excited to see what the future held.</p>

Even when we chose to do long distance I still had those walls up because I was scared. When you told me that you love me I was flooded with happiness, but I was also overwhelmed because everything was happening so fast and I didn‚Äôt have time to process everything. I knew in that moment that it wasn‚Äôt mine, it was yours. And I wanted to be really sure before I said it back. Will, you make me so happy, the happiest I have ever been I think in my whole life. You complete me in ways I didn‚Äôt even know I needed, you are my blind spot. I know I have been feeling this for a long time even though I was running from it. I just wanted to be really sure because I have never experienced love like this, but I love you so much Will. I harbor so much fear in my life these days, and I‚Äôm not going to get let that encompass how I feel about you. I‚Äôm all in Will and I think I have know that since the night we met."</p>

									<p>Within a few weeks, Alexx and Will were in UT to visit Will's parents and see the new home. On a whim, Will checked the local shelter websites to see if there were any cute kittens seeking forever homes, and lo and behold there lay the future Okonomiyaki, a black domestic long haired kitten, yearning to be part of the family. Will and Alexx drove into Salt Lake City from Park City and adopted her on sight. Will named her Okonomiyaki after the Japanese pancakes he and his best friend used to make in San Diego together. She would be called Miko for short. Small, spunky, and sassy, Miko joined the family.</p>

									<p>On a random Friday night, a mutual friend of Alexx and Will, Cameryn, invited a group to go out to a bar called Kilowatt in Ocean Beach. Prior to the evening's festivities, Cameryn asked Alexx <i>I invited my friend Will, do you think he's cute?</i> to which Alexx replied, <i>eh, no</i>. <span class="alexx">Correction: Alexx shrugged, and no words were said.</span></p>
									<p>However, when Will showed up to meet Cameryn and company, Will noticed that Alexx couldn't take her eyes off him; she stared at him from across the room. <span class="alexx">Correction: our eyes immediately, mutually locked, until Alexx hastily turned away after realizing that too much time had passed.</span> They clicked instantly and spent the whole night chatting, realizing they had numerous mutual friends from USD. At the end of the evening, we walked out to our vehicles, and Will asked for her number.</p>

									<p>Will had known from almost the beginning that he loved Alexx, but wanted to wait until the perfect moment to tell her. On a misty morning in Menlo Park, he drove his lovely lady up to Valparaiso Hill, where the two embraced under a beautiful rainbow in the foggy skyline. Will looked Alexx in the eyes and told her <i>I'm all in</i>, paused, and then <i>I love you, Alexx</i>.</p>

									<p>Hey Alexx üòä</p>
									<p>I hope you're having a merry, merry Christmas!! This is a temporary message that I'll change later after we've actually had our first Christmas!</p>
									<p>I still can't believe how lucky I am. I wake up every day lucky to be dating such a caring, thoughtful, and driven person - a literal goddess on earth. You inspire me every day to be the best version of myself. I love camping with you, eating with you, dancing with you, and I just can't get enough of you. You make me <strong>so</strong> happy. If I'm ever having a stressful day, you calm me down and make me laugh, and I'm so lucky to call you mine this Christmas.</p>
									<p>I wanted to give you something that we could use together on one of our adventures. I hope you like it and smile every time we use it! üòä</p>
